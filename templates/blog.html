            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Learn about nutrition and healthy eating.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> Aim for a balanced intake of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to support overall health and fitness goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before, during, and after workouts to maintain hydration levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Workout Nutrition:</strong> Consume a balanced meal containing carbohydrates and protein 1-3 hours before exercise to fuel your workout and optimize performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Workout Nutrition:</strong> Within 30-60 minutes after exercise, consume a combination of protein and carbohydrates to aid muscle recovery and replenish glycogen stores.</li>
                <li><strong>Whole Foods:</strong> Prioritize whole, minimally processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats for nutrient density and sustained energy levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Portion Control:</strong> Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating and to maintain a healthy weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Snack Smart:</strong> Choose nutritious snacks such as nuts, yogurt, fruits, or whole grain crackers to keep energy levels stable between meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit Added Sugars and Saturated Fats:</strong> Reduce intake of foods high in added sugars and saturated fats, which can contribute to weight gain and health issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Meal Timing:</strong> Eat regular meals and snacks throughout the day to maintain steady energy levels and support metabolism.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eat when you're hungry and stop when you're satisfied.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthy Cooking Methods:</strong> Opt for cooking methods like baking, grilling, steaming, or saut√©ing with minimal added fats to preserve nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Plan meals and snacks in advance to ensure you have nutritious options available and avoid relying on convenience foods.</li>
                <li><strong>Mindful Eating:</strong> Eat slowly, savoring each bite, and be mindful of the flavors and textures of your food. This helps prevent overeating and promotes digestion.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Supplements:</strong> Consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian if considering supplements to fill nutrient gaps, especially for vitamins and minerals.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderation:</strong> Practice moderation with all foods, including treats and indulgences, to maintain a balanced approach to nutrition.</li>
